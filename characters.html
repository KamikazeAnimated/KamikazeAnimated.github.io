				<div class="char_desc">
					<h3>MARKESHA NIN</h3>
					<p>Up walls, down alleys, or across rooftops, Markesha moves like a lightning-struck rabbit.</p> 
					<p>Her fleet feet are only outpaced by her biting wit. 
					Whether physical or emotional, battle is not her forte - she’s a runner, not a fighter. Constant movement to make ends meet keeps her body
					strong, her mind clear, and her heart from breaking.</p>
					<p>The memory of her absent mother is forever at hand, driving Markesha toward a destiny she cannot imagine.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="char_desc">
					<h3>KAMIKAZE</h3>
					<p>Markesha has made a life of running away, but as Kamikaze she is a reckless force of nature, taking risks
					and fighting wars she never could without a mask. </p>
					<p>While Kamikaze's anti-grav pack may appear to let her fly, it really only allows for higher jumps, further
					leaps, faster sprints and slower falls. The pack's power must be vented on a regular basis, or it could 
					overload taking Kamikaze and the entire city with it.</p>
					<p>Kamikaze's gloves serve dual roles: power vents and high-voltage taser. She uses these gloves to short 
					out low-insulation computers or low-intelligence assailants, but keeping them away from water is a 
					MUST.</p>

				</div>
				
				<div class="char_desc">
					<h3>TOSHI NIN</h3>
					<p>Though blind, Toshi Nin strives to meet every sunrise with a smile no 
					matter how much self-delusion it takes. </p>
					<p>His daughter, Markesha is the source of his greatest joy and his
					deepest fear. Broken down by a lifetime in Outer Trinity, compliance is his only way of staying safe. 
					But Toshi hides a secret talent that may allow him to protect the only family he has left.

				<div class="char_img">
					<center><img src="img/Orson_web_300.png"></center>
				</div>
				<div class="char_desc">
					<h3>ORSON STYKES</h3>
					<p>To Orson you're either an asset or you're dead. Leader of the rouge sabotage unit Markesha works for, 
					he's the brains behind Kamikaze's kinetic brawn.</p>
					<p>Orson is determined to force a regime change in the 
					city-state they call home. Beneath his stoic facade is a laser focused, two-faced strategist bent on 
					advancing his own vengeful agenda by any means necessary.</p>

			<div class="char_frame">
				<div class="char_img">
					<center><img src="img/Link_web_300.png"></center>
				</div>
				<div class="char_desc">
					<h3>LINK SOHN</h3>
					<p>Link is a legendary hacker...in his own mind. If his work ethic matched his talent and ego, he'd be the 
					most sought after hacker in the city.</p>
					<p>In the past he settled for working odd jobs while dreaming of the 
					glamor and prestige awaiting him once he “made it.” Now in the big leagues, Link hides a fear of 
					failure behind a lot of swagger and bravado. He's good, but he's in over his head, and he'll die before he
					admits it.</p>

			<div class="char_frame">
				<div class="char_img">
					<center><img src="img/Audrey_web_300.png"></center>
				</div>
				<div class="char_desc">
					<h3>AUDREY DALMA</h3>
					<p>It's hard to imagine Audrey as a world class scientific prodigy, but without her inventions, Kamikaze 
					would be tethered firmly to the ground. </p>
					<p>Audrey's revolutionary inventions have caused her heartbreak 
					in the past, making her cautious about who she shares her secrets with. Her caring nature makes her the
					heart of the team, just don't ask too many questions.</p>
				</div>

			<div class="char_frame">
				<div class="char_img">
					<center><img src="img/Toro_web_300.png"></center>
				</div>
				<div class="char_desc">
					<h3>CLAY "TORO" BLACKTHORNE</h3>
					<p>If anyone is Sheriff in Outer Trinity it's Toro.</p>
					<p>His gang, the Razors, are arguably the most organized 
					and dangerous group of brutes in Trinity. The Razors have survived endless turf wars through 
					Toro's ferocity and leadership. Once a believer in justice, he now relishes the power of uncontested 
					authority. </p>
				</div>

			<div class="char_frame">
				<div class="char_img">
					<center><img src="img/Iris_web_300.png"></center>
				</div>
				<div class="char_desc">
					<h3>IRIS</h3>
					<p>As much of an enigma as the company she represents, Iris is the sole representative of a foreign power 
					house. Implacable and timeless to the outside world, she would give anything to leave it all behind, but 
					the only way out may cost Iris her life.</p>
				</div>

			<div class="char_frame">
				<div class="char_img">
					<center><img src="img/Julian_web_300.png"></center>
				</div>
				<div class="char_desc">
					<h3>JUILAN FOSTER</h3>
					<p>Julian Foster is an outlaw grower...of vegetables. He's a giant, but those massive hands are better at 
					growing plants than beating punks.</p>
					<p>Julian sells his black market food in an attempt to keep the only 
					rebellion in the city from crumbling under it's fractured leadership. A past steeped in shame has left 
					Julian unwilling to take the reins. But Julian has the potential to become a great leader...if he could only
					find his backbone.</p>

			<div class="char_frame">
				<div class="char_img">
					<center><img src="img/Flare_web_300.png"></center>
				</div>
				<div class="char_desc">
					<h3>FLARE</h3>
					<p>If hands need to get dirty and they can't be yours, Flare is the woman to call.</p>
					<p>Causing chaos and 
					mayhem wherever she goes, her reputation for getting the job done is flawless. Flare is Kamikaze's 
					most unpredictable and provocative nemesis. To Orson...she's his greatest threat.</p>
